## Contribution Guidelines

- If you're planning to implement a new feature I will recommend you to discuss with me before you start coding so you won't end up working on something that I don't want to implement. Create an Issue with proper name and content for discussion.
- You can email me on [connectwithadarsha@gmail.com](connectwithadarsha@gmail.com) or message on twitter/[@adarshatweets](https://twitter.com/adarshatweets) if you need any help understanding the code.
- For Contributing to this project
  1. Fork project.
  2. Create a branch with the name of feature that you're working on (e.g. 'auth-api').
  3. Once you're done coding create a merge request from your new branch to my master. (Read the Local Development section below for local setup guidelines)
  4. That's it from ya side! wait till I merge :D
